# Arduino

Coding is cool but what's even cooler is writing code to interact with your
environment. Arduino is a company that produces open-source hardware, software,
and sells boards, or microcontroller, kits for use in interactive projects.

## Why Arduino?

Think of arduino like interfacing with the world. It bridges the gap between
humans and electronics.

What's important to note about the arduino is that both the hardware and software
are open source. This means it has a pretty strong community where people
are encouraged to adapt and develop on the existing tools provided, which has
allowed to its explosive popularity.

While Arduino makes many types of kits, all of them are based on the same general
ideas. The microcontroller takes digital and analog inputs, processes that data
according to what the user has programmed in using the Arduino Programming
Language. Then, it generates the desired output through use of circuitry and
basic electrical engineering. Simple yet elegant.

## The Basics

Hardware: arduinos use a microcontroller, which is like a mini brain,
capable of taking both [digital](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/DigitalPins)
and [analog](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/AnalogInput)
inputs. The input can either be hardcoded in or the microcontroller can receive
data from the environment, USB, or even Twitter. The hardware is open-source
and hacking it is actively encouraged, to awesome ends.

Software: arduino comes with its own integrated development environment, which is
basically software that includes everything someone would need to use the hardware.
This includes a compiler, libraries, GUI, and more and is STILL all open-source.
The language is based on a language called Processing and the IDE is written in Java.
Free to download and use, there's a strong community of contributors constantly
improving it.

You buy your microcontroller, get the necessary materials, download the software,
and you're pretty much all set to create whatever it is you're after. The microcontroller
works like any regular circuit. If you're not quite up to date on your electical
engineering, the power source provides force, which allows electrons to move
through the circuit, where they are then directed to different parts of the
controller and perform specific actions. It's ok if this is still witchcraft.

## Looking Ahead...

Arduino used to just be for hobbyists and serial DIY-ers but has exapnded. Other
types of microcontrollers are available for use, often with other languages.
Arduino technology makes interactive programming projects accessible to people
of all skill ranges and isn't cost prohibitive.

In addition to increased use in art, it has high potential in scientific fields
for interactive modeling and data manipulation and display. It has been used in
drones, 3D printing, medicine, agriculture, and is expanding in its implementation.
Arduino also provides a great way to introduce kids to programming.

Similar technologies like [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi)
already exist, supporting different programming languages and innate capabilities.
There's even a few products being developed for use with JavaScript, such as
[Tessel](http://www.dragoninnovation.com/projects/22-tessel).
